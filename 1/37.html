                            In Vishvamitra's wise discourse, they sat,<br>Rama and Lakshmana, in wonder and chat,<br>They praised the legend, the daughters divine,<br>And to the sage, their voices did incline.<br>"Your words on Ganga, oh, Brahman so wise,<br>Tell us, with emphasis, make it arise,<br>Why does she flow in three courses, we seek,<br>Her fame in three worlds, let us speak."<br>Vishvamitra then began the tale to tell,<br>Of Shiva and Uma, a story to unveil,<br>"In ancient days, in a cosmic dance,<br>Shiva consumed poison, took a chance.<br>He wedded Uma, with eyes for his bride,<br>A hundred divine years, by their side,<br>Yet no offspring came from their embrace,<br>Gods worried, disaster they did chase.<br>'Who will emerge from Uma's embrace,<br>And sustain their divine grace?<br>Oh, God of Gods, with mercy so vast,<br>Let your divine seed in virility last.<br>Practice yogic asceticism, we pray,<br>Retain your seed and light our way,<br>Preserve the worlds from chaos and strife,<br>Don't render the universe devoid of life.'<br>Shiva agreed, with a solemn decree,<br>His seed within him, his love set free,<br>But a part stirred, uncontainable, they said,<br>'Who can hold it?' the gods inquired ahead.<br>'The earth will bear it,' the gods declared,<br>So Shiva's seed to the earth was shared,<br>Fire-god and Wind-god, they intervened,<br>To ensure the world remained serene.<br><br>  Fire-god compacted Shiva's divine might,<br>Emerging as a mountain, pure and white,<br>From this mountain, Kaartikeya arose,<br>All gods and sages, in reverence, froze.<br>Uma and Shiva, with joy in their heart,<br>Were adored by gods, a divine art,<br>But Uma's anger, a curse did release,<br>On gods and the earth, her wrath didn't cease.<br>'You are unworthy of fathering a son,<br>Your wives will bear none, one by one,<br>The earth, too, shall lose her unique grace,<br>Becoming a wife to many, in this space.<br>Her children's delight, I shall deny,<br>Tarnished by my anger, they shall cry,<br>Earth, you are undeserving of my kin,<br>For your reluctance to let my son begin.'<br>Seeing gods distressed by Uma's wrath,<br>Shiva moved westward, choosing a path,<br>He settled in the Himalayan domain,<br>In ascetic bliss, his peace to attain.<br>This, Rama, is the legend I narrate,<br>Of Goddess Uma, her love and her fate,<br>Now, Ganga's emergence I shall proclaim,<br>Listen, with Lakshmana, to the tale's acclaim.
