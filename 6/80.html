                            Upon hearing Makaraksha's fate, Ravana raged with ire,<br>His teeth ground in anger, his thoughts on fire.<br>He turned to Indrajit, his son of great might,<br>"Go, kill Rama and Lakshmana," he ordered in the night.<br><br>"O hero," he said, "you've conquered Indra in the past,<br>Now defeat these two, make their victory your last.<br>You are unmatched in strength, in battles you prevail,<br>Go, make them fall, let not their efforts avail."<br><br>Indrajit, obedient, to the fire made a plea,<br>Offered oblations with care, with devotion and glee.<br>As he did so, female demons in red turbans came near,<br>Their presence foretelling a battle both fierce and clear.<br><br>Weapons of war turned to tools for the rite,<br>As the sacrificial fire leapt, its flames shining bright.<br>The god of fire himself appeared in the blaze,<br>Accepting the offering with a majestic, fiery gaze.<br><br>Now equipped and ready, his chariot sublime,<br>Drawn by four horses, prepared for the prime.<br>With arrows and bow, its body adorned with gold,<br>Indrajit readied for battle, his spirit bold.<br><br>His chariot's flag-post waved with a fiery flare,<br>Decorated with gems, a sight quite rare.<br>Protected by a potent missile, with Brahma's grace,<br>Indrajit emerged, vanished, then took his place.<br><br>Invisible and swift, he descended from the sky,<br>Targeting Rama and Lakshmana from up high.<br>His arrows rained down like a tempestuous storm,<br>Covering the heroes, their forms they deform.<br><br>The sky obscured, the quarters cloaked in haze,<br>Indrajit's attack left no escape or ways.<br>Though Rama and Lakshmana fought with might,<br>His arrows eluded, disappearing from sight.<br><br>Amidst the dark clouds, the warriors stood tall,<br>As Indrajit continued his relentless thrall.<br>Steel arrows rained down, a relentless pour,<br>But the heroes fought back, their resolve evermore.<br><br>Golden arrows, sharp and true, they released,<br>To counter the onslaught, their power increased.<br>Yet Indrajit remained hidden from view,<br>His tactics elusive, his moves they couldn't construe.<br><br>As the battle raged on, with no end in sight,<br>Indrajit's darkness concealed his might.<br>But Rama and Lakshmana, with courage they'd gleaned,<br>Fought on undeterred, their spirits redeemed.<br><br>Invisible and fierce, Indrajit held his sway,<br>While Rama and Lakshmana continued to slay.<br>The monkeys watched, their hopes still high,<br>As the battle unfolded beneath the dark sky.<br><br>Lakshmana, in anger, proposed a mystic plan,<br>To employ potent missiles as part of their clan.<br>But Rama cautioned restraint, their purpose defined,<br>To target Indrajit alone, in the battle entwined.<br><br>With mystic missiles they'd pierce through the night,<br>Defeating the demon with unwavering might.<br>Though demons fell, it was Indrajit they'd seek,<br>Invisible or not, their victory they'd speak.<br><br>In the midst of this chaos, their thoughts intertwined,<br>Rama and Lakshmana, with purpose aligned.<br>To conquer Indrajit, the fierce, powerful foe,<br>Their mystic missiles aimed, they'd lay low.
