                            Hearing that roar, like thunderbolts on high,<br>The monkeys fled, fear flashing in each eye.<br>Hanuman, son of wind, spoke clear and bold,<br>"Why run, dear brothers, where's your courage, old?<br><br>Stand by my side, let's face this fearsome fray,<br>Our noble birth commands we do not sway.<br>For valour's flame still burns within our hearts,<br>To flee this fight is not how heroes play."<br><br>His words struck chords of courage, hearts revived,<br>The monkeys rallied, to their chief they dived.<br>With rocks and trees, they charged the demon foe,<br>As flames consume, their power began to show.<br><br>With mighty boulders hurled, they sought to crush,<br>Indrajit's chariot, with a fearsome rush.<br>But demons swift, with horses, chariot, fled,<br>The stones struck earth, not him they left for dead.<br><br>Undaunted, monkeys roared, their battle cry,<br>Like Yama's wrath when worlds begin to die.<br>They pummeled foes, with fury unrestrained,<br>As Hanuman's force a path of death maintained.<br><br>A massive rock, at Indrajit was flung,<br>His horses fled, their speedy hooves were sprung.<br>The missile split, not reached its marked intent,<br>But demons near were crushed, their bodies rent.<br><br>In rage, Indrajit charged forth once more,<br>A hail of arrows through the sky he'd pour.<br>His demons, armed with weapons keen and bright,<br>Joined in the fight, fierce as the darkest night.<br><br>Yet Hanuman stood tall amidst the fray,<br>Defying demon force, come what may.<br>With trees and rocks, his brethren joined the dance,<br>A wild, relentless, all-consuming trance.<br><br>They battered demons, twisted in their pain,<br>Who writhed and rolled, but could not break the chain.<br>Indrajit, too, fought fiercely, undeterred,<br>In battle's rage, where warriors' fates were stirred.<br><br>Amidst the chaos, Hanuman's voice rang clear,<br>"Retreat," he cried, dispelling doubt and fear.<br>"Our Sita's fate, by cruel hands, is sealed,<br>Inform our lord, let sorrow be revealed."<br><br>Thus spoke Hanuman, leading them away,<br>To where great Rama waited, dawn of day.<br>Indrajit sought refuge, altar-bound,<br>Pouring oblations on that sacred ground.<br><br>The flames arose, with crimson tongues they licked,<br>The offering consumed, the demons' hopes tricked.<br>Indrajit, well-versed in dark rites and lore,<br>Stood strong with demons, ready for the war.
