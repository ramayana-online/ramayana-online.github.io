                            In battle's tumult, fierce and grand,<br>Between demons and monkeys' band,<br>Rama to Jambavan did say,<br>"O excellent one! Make no delay!<br><br>The rattling arms, a dreadful sound,<br>By Hanuman, in feat renowned,<br>I'm sure, O lord of bears so bold,<br>Go help him now, let's not withhold."<br><br>Jambavan, with his forces strong,<br>Responded to Rama's call, ere long.<br>To the western gate, they made their way,<br>Where Hanuman in the midst did sway.<br><br>Jambavan beheld Hanuman's might,<br>Leading monkeys in the perilous fight,<br>But when he saw the bear brigade,<br>Like a dark cloud, they were arrayed.<br><br>Hanuman, in retreat, did sway,<br>Seeing the bears come to join the fray,<br>Then to Rama, with sorrow, he spoke,<br>Of Sita's fate, his heart did choke.<br><br>"While we fought, Indrajit, so vile,<br>Killed Sita, caused our hearts to pile,<br>With grief and sadness, O Rama dear,<br>I bring this news, let it be clear."<br><br>Rama, upon hearing this woeful tale,<br>Fell to the ground, like a tree frail,<br>Monkeys gathered around in haste,<br>With water and scents, his strength to taste.<br><br>Lakshmana, in sorrow, took Rama's side,<br>His ailing brother, he did chide,<br>"Virtue can't shield from life's cruel blows,<br>In this world where fortune ebbs and flows.<br><br>Righteousness, it seems, is but a sham,<br>For Ravana's deeds bring no damnation's slam,<br>While you, in virtue, have faced such plight,<br>The fruits of both seem out of sight.<br><br>If virtue's path were truly sure,<br>No evil could your heart endure,<br>So, it seems, in this fateful dance,<br>Virtue and vice switch roles by chance.<br><br>If unrighteousness can thrive and bloom,<br>While virtue's path leads to your doom,<br>Then virtue, I fear, is but a shade,<br>In the realm where destinies are laid.<br><br>Or, perhaps, it's not about the act,<br>But the rituals prescribed, in fact,<br>For if one kills by sacred rite,<br>It's the ritual's fruit, not the doer's plight.<br><br>O Rama, virtue's path is unclear,<br>In times of joy or times of fear,<br>It may not be real, as it seems,<br>But I speak this to calm your dreams.<br><br>If virtue's weak, surrendering to might,<br>Then, perhaps, it's time to see the light,<br>Let virtue play a lesser role,<br>And might befriend your noble soul.<br><br>Remember, truth has its own cost,<br>Our father's lies, though they were lost,<br>Yet, you accepted his royal decree,<br>Is truth the path it claims to be?<br><br>Even Indra, lord of heavens high,<br>Performed a sacrifice, don't deny,<br>Killing a sage, a sinful act,<br>Yet, his throne remained intact.<br><br>O Rama, virtue's power, it's true,<br>Is mighty when combined with strength's hue,<br>So, let's embrace both, side by side,<br>In this world where fate and fortune ride.<br><br>Virtue's roots, you may have clipped away,<br>With your recent choice, come what may,<br>But wealth, my brother, has its worth,<br>It brings joy, it's not a curse from birth.<br><br>Prosperity and kin, they stand by gold,<br>In riches, a man's story is told,<br>A virtuous soul, when wealth is near,<br>Faces no trouble, has naught to fear.<br><br>But the penniless, seeking wealth in vain,<br>Turn to sinful deeds, bear life's pain,<br>Friendship and kin, they fade from sight,<br>Only wealth makes a man's life bright.<br><br>O king, from riches, all blessings flow,<br>Delight, pride, control, and woe,<br>Wealth gives power, and wisdom's grace,<br>A life of comfort, in wealth's embrace.<br><br>Sita, your beloved, was stolen away,<br>In your exile, a demon's prey,<br>Today, through my might, we shall restore,<br>What Indrajit stole, we'll settle the score.<br><br>So, rise, O Rama, the strong and wise,<br>Let not sorrow cloud your eyes,<br>With discipline and soul so great,<br>Together, we'll rewrite our fate.<br><br>Let not wealth or virtue confound,<br>For both have their limits, I expound,<br>In this world of change and strife,<br>We'll find the balance for a better life."
