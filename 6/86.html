                            In dire straits, Vibhishaṇ spoke,<br>To Lakshmana, his words awoke.<br>"Let the demon army, dark as night,<br>Face the monkeys in a fearsome fight.<br><br>O Lakshmana, give it your all,<br>Break their ranks, let their forces fall.<br>When the demon army is no more,<br>Indrajit's magic will lose its core."<br><br>"Rush forth now, with arrows like thunderbolts,<br>On the enemies, fierce in assaults.<br>Until Indrajit completes his dark scheme,<br>Fight with all your might, as it may seem.<br><br>End the evil one's unjust reign,<br>His cruel acts, his dark domain.<br>Bring fear to him, let Lanka see,<br>The might of truth and victory."<br><br>Lakshmana, with auspicious signs,<br>Sent forth his arrows in straight lines.<br>Monkeys and bears, like trees they fight,<br>Against demons in battle's might.<br><br>Demons, too, with a deadly aim,<br>Attacked the monkeys in their claim.<br>With arrows sharp, and swords so keen,<br>A fierce battle, a fearsome scene.<br><br>In the tumultuous clash of might,<br>Lanka's echoes rang through the night.<br>The sky with weapons was shrouded dense,<br>As fear and courage waged their defense.<br><br>Demons of fearsome strength and face,<br>Threw their weapons in a frenzied race.<br>Monkeys, too, in their fierce attack,<br>Used trees and peaks to beat them back.<br><br>Among the demons, fear did swell,<br>Facing bears and monkeys, fighting well.<br>Indrajit, their leader, stood aside,<br>As his army scattered, he could not hide.<br><br>Enraged and bloodshot, his eyes ablaze,<br>Indrajit emerged from the shadowy haze.<br>In his chariot, armed for the fight,<br>He looked like death, a fearsome sight.<br><br>Seeing Hanuman, his foe so bold,<br>Indrajit's heart grew bitter and cold.<br>"Approach that monkey, take me near,<br>Or he'll destroy our forces here."<br><br>His charioteer obeyed with speed,<br>To Hanuman, they rode, indeed.<br>Indrajit unleashed his deadly storm,<br>Swords, spears, and axes took their form.<br><br>But Hanuman, with fury and might,<br>Received the weapons without a fright.<br>"Face me like a warrior, if you dare,<br>In this battle, let's make it fair.<br><br>Come closer, fight with all your might,<br>Feel my force, in this dreadful fight.<br>But, if you shy from an even game,<br>You'll leave this battle in defeat and shame."<br><br>Vibhishaṇ then spoke, wise and bold,<br>As Indrajit's chariot, the scene did unfold.<br>"O Lakshmana, with your arrows so bright,<br>End Indrajit's dark, conjuring plight.<br><br>His chariot, like a mountain, stands tall,<br>But your arrows will make it fall.<br>Strike him down, make him pay,<br>For his dark acts, in the light of day."<br><br>Hearing Vibhishaṇ's counsel and plea,<br>Lakshmana turned to face the enemy.<br>Indrajit, a mountain in his chariot, sat,<br>A fearsome sight, with a deadly spat.<br><br>Arrows like thunderbolts, Lakshmana sent,<br>Towards Indrajit, his aim intent.<br>The battle raged on, fierce and grand,<br>As the hero stood, bow in hand.
