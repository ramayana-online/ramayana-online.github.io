                            In that thicket, Vibhishaṇ led the way,<br>Guiding Lakshmana to where they'd lay.<br>He pointed to a banyan tree, dark and grim,<br>And spoke of a ritual awaiting him.<br><br>"After spirits are pleased at this sacred place,<br>Indrajit proceeds to the battle's embrace.<br>He becomes invisible before his grand fight,<br>But you must strike swiftly, with all your might.<br><br>Destroy Indrajit, his chariot and his might,<br>Before he reaches that banyan tree's sight,"<br>Lakshmana nodded, bow drawn to defend,<br>To follow Vibhishaṇ's counsel, he'd intend.<br><br>Indrajit, clad in armor, fiery chariot in tow,<br>A scion of Sage Paulastya, a formidable foe.<br>Lakshmana challenged, "Come, let us engage,<br>In battle, as warriors, on this world's stage."<br><br>But Indrajit, with brilliance in his eye,<br>Saw Vibhishaṇ and began to imply,<br>"You, demon-born, brother to my kin,<br>Why turn against us? What's the reason within?<br><br>Family ties, you seem to disregard,<br>Choosing enemies, it's truly quite hard.<br>You leave your own kindred, your blood and race,<br>For the sake of our foes, it's a grave disgrace."<br><br>Vibhishaṇ replied with patience and grace,<br>"My nature is goodness, it's not a race.<br>I value virtue and act with care,<br>Though born a demon, it's love I bear.<br><br>I shun cruel deeds and seek what's right,<br>Abandoning evil, embracing the light.<br>In a world of strife, where good is rare,<br>A brother's heart, I choose to share."<br><br>"Your words are harsh, but I remain true,<br>Respect for elders, I hold that too.<br>Though we may differ, I stay by your side,<br>Our bonds of blood, I'll never hide.<br><br>Abandoning one's kin, 'tis a grievous sin,<br>I won't cast aside, even if I win.<br>Despite my demon birth, I won't be swayed,<br>By a brother's love, I'm firmly stayed."<br><br>"Evil deeds bring about our own decline,<br>To happiness and virtue, they draw no line.<br>Avoid the wicked, their path is dire,<br>Like a venomous snake, poised to strike fire.<br><br>Three faults, they bring utter destruction,<br>Stealing others' wealth, a vile seduction.<br>Lusting for another's spouse, a dark blight,<br>Excessive distrust, brings eternal night."<br><br>"Such faults have obscured our brother's grace,<br>Ravana's virtues hidden, lost in the chase.<br>His arrogance, anger, and endless fights,<br>Have veiled his goodness, like clouds obscure heights.<br><br>Because of these vices, my choice is clear,<br>Ravana and his city shall disappear.<br>Lanka's end is near, as fate decides,<br>For you and your father, pride overrides."<br><br>"Speak as you will, with arrogance bold,<br>Foolish and indisciplined, your story unfolds.<br>You're ensnared by Death, your doom you chase,<br>Today's harsh words sealed your fate's embrace.<br><br>You'll never reach that banyan tree's hold,<br>Nor survive, as Lakshmana's strength takes its toll.<br>Fight him if you dare, in this battlefield's wake,<br>But today, with your army, you'll meet your fate.<br><br>Exhaust your weapons, show your might,<br>In Lakshmana's range, you won't see the light.<br>With your army, today, you won't return,<br>For Lakshmana's arrows, fierce and swift, shall burn."
