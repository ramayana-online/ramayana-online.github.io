stride.<br>I'll return with a chariot new,<br>Keep them at bay, that's all you must do."<br><br>With trickery, he left the field,<br>Leaving demons to a fate concealed.<br>Preparing chariot, sleek and gold,<br>Armed to conquer, fierce and bold.<br><br>He rode back out, troops by his side,<br>From Lanka's gates, they didn't hide.<br>Lakshmana, Vibhishaṇ stood,<br>As Indrajit came, with war's full
