                            On that fierce field, where chaos reigned supreme,<br>Where arrows flew like sparks in nightly dream,<br>The monkeys faced a hail of arrows, dire,<br>From Ravana's wrath, a storm of flaming fire.<br><br>As moths before a blazing fire must flee,<br>So monkeys ran from arrows, swift and free.<br>Ravana, like a tempest, charged ahead,<br>His army scattering monkeys, filled with dread.<br><br>The fearless Sugriva, swift in the fray,<br>Took charge, prepared to fight another day.<br>With tree in hand, he charged the demon horde,<br>While monkey-warriors followed, undeterred.<br><br>Sugriva's mighty roar shook land and sky,<br>He crushed the demons, making giants fly.<br>His blows were like a storm that none could stand,<br>As trees were smashed like dust within his hand.<br><br>The demon Virupaksha, fierce and bold,<br>With bow in hand, a tale of might untold,<br>Descended from his chariot, full of grace,<br>Mounted an elephant, prepared to face.<br><br>His arrows rained on Sugriva, fierce and true,<br>But monkey-king stood tall, his courage grew.<br>A tree in hand, he struck the elephant's face,<br>Which roared in pain, retreating from the chase.<br><br>Descending then, Virupaksha's sword held high,<br>He faced Sugriva, hatred in his eye.<br>But Sugriva, undaunted, stood his ground,<br>With fists of fury, strength in every pound.<br><br>A rock he hurled, like thunder in the sky,<br>At Virupaksha, as the battle's cry.<br>But the demon, swift, evaded the blow,<br>Striking Sugriva, bringing him low.<br><br>Yet, Sugriva rose, his rage renewed,<br>With fist of fury, courage unsubdued.<br>A thunderous slap upon the demon's brow,<br>Sent Virupaksha reeling, pain on his brow.<br><br>Sugriva's chest took blows of sword, so keen,<br>Yet rose again, his spirit still unclean.<br>A mighty slap, a thunderclap so loud,<br>Struck Virupaksha, lost within the crowd.<br><br>He reeled, his temple crushed, a dreadful sight,<br>His body oozed with blood, his strength in flight.<br>Monkeys saw this demon's gruesome plight,<br>And both armies roared, like oceans in their might.<br><br>As Virupaksha fell, bathed in crimson red,<br>Both demon and monkey armies filled with dread.<br>The battlefield, like Ganga in her surge,<br>With blood and chaos, told a tragic dirge.
